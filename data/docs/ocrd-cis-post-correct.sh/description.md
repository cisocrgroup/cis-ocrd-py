# Description of ocrd-cis-post-correct.sh {#description .concept}
This bash script runs the post correction using a pre-trained
[model](http://cis.lmu.de/~finkf/model.zip).  If additional support
OCRs should be used, models for these OCR steps are required and must
be configured in an according configuration file (see ocrd-tool.json).
